    "   - **Sample Structure**: For each plant and condition, create a table with:\n",
    "     - Row: One processed sound event\n",
    "     - Columns: Extracted features + metadata (plant ID, species, condition)\n",
    "   - **Train-Test Split**:\n",
    "     - Implement leave-one-plant-out cross-validation (LOPO-CV)\n",
    "     - Create a function that takes a plant ID as input and returns training and testing sets\n",
    "     - For each fold, exclude all sounds from one specific plant for testing\n",
    "   - **Balancing**: For each binary comparison, randomly undersample the larger class to match the smaller class size\n",
    "   - **Normalization**: Apply StandardScaler (Z-score normalization) to all features\n",
    "   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply PCA, retaining components that explain 95% of variance"
